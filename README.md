# Immutable Updates to Objects and Arrays

In the index.js file, make sure for every task's function, you return a new array/object with the updates needed.

You can run the tests to help guide you with the script `npm test` in your terminal. Make sure that each of the tests passes before moving onto the next one.

## Things to do:

- Make sure you `npm i` to install all of the packages that you need.
- Work your way through the tasks in [index.js](index.js). Don't worry about that fact that you can't see the arrays or items; they can all be found within the index.test.js file.
